ngJq    其他类. 在 jq 存在的时候强制使用内置的 jqLite. 该指令不常用
Use this directive to force the angular.element library. This should be used to force either jqLite by leaving ng-jq blank or setting the name of the jquery variable under window (eg. jQuery).

+ ngApp	其他类. 自动启动 ng 模块
Use this directive to auto-bootstrap an AngularJS application. The ngApp directive designates the root element of the application and is typically placed near the root element of the page - e.g. on the <body> or <html> tags.

+ a	标签类. 重写 a 标签的默认点击行为 在 href 为空时阻止触发事件
Modifies the default behavior of the html a tag so that the default action is prevented when the href attribute is empty.

+ ngHref	属性类.
Using Angular markup like {{hash}} in an href attribute will make the link go to the wrong URL if the user clicks it before Angular has a chance to replace the {{hash}} markup with its value. Until Angular replaces the markup the link will be broken and will most likely return a 404 error. The ngHref directive solves this problem.

+ ngSrc	属性类.
Using Angular markup like {{hash}} in a src attribute doesn't work right: The browser will fetch from the URL with the literal text {{hash}} until Angular replaces the expression inside {{hash}}. The ngSrc directive solves this problem.

ngSrcset	属性类. 响应式属性. 不属于基础指令
Using Angular markup like {{hash}} in a srcset attribute doesn't work right: The browser will fetch from the URL with the literal text {{hash}} until Angular replaces the expression inside {{hash}}. The ngSrcset directive solves this problem.

+ ngDisabled	表单类. 
This directive sets the disabled attribute on the element (typically a form control, e.g. input, button, select etc.) if the expression inside ngDisabled evaluates to truthy.

+ ngChecked	表单类. 
Sets the checked attribute on the element, if the expression inside ngChecked is truthy.

+ ngReadonly	表单类. 
Sets the readonly attribute on the element, if the expression inside ngReadonly is truthy. Note that readonly applies only to input elements with specific types. See the input docs on MDN for more information.

+ ngSelected	表单类. 
Sets the selected attribute on the element, if the expression inside ngSelected is truthy.

ngOpen	属性类. 不属于基础指令.
Sets the open attribute on the element, if the expression inside ngOpen is truthy.

? ngForm	表单类.
Nestable alias of form directive. HTML does not allow nesting of form elements. It is useful to nest forms, for example if the validity of a sub-group of controls needs to be determined.

? form	表单类.
Directive that instantiates FormController.

+ textarea	表单类.
HTML textarea element control with angular data-binding. The data-binding and validation properties of this element are exactly the same as those of the input element.

+ input	表单类.
HTML input element control. When used together with ngModel, it provides data-binding, input state control, and validation. Input control follows HTML5 input types and polyfills the HTML5 validation behavior for older browsers.

+ ngValue	表单类.
Binds the given expression to the value of the element.

+ ngBind	其他类.
The ngBind attribute tells Angular to replace the text content of the specified HTML element with the value of a given expression, and to update the text content when the value of that expression changes.

? ngBindTemplate	其他类.
The ngBindTemplate directive specifies that the element text content should be replaced with the interpolation of the template in the ngBindTemplate attribute. Unlike ngBind, the ngBindTemplate can contain multiple {{ }} expressions. This directive is needed since some HTML elements (such as TITLE and OPTION) cannot contain SPAN elements.

+ ngBindHtml	其他类.
Evaluates the expression and inserts the resulting HTML into the element in a secure way. By default, the resulting HTML content will be sanitized using the $sanitize service. To utilize this functionality, ensure that $sanitize is available, for example, by including ngSanitize in your module's dependencies (not in core Angular). In order to use ngSanitize in your module's dependencies, you need to include "angular-sanitize.js" in your application.

+ ngChange	事件类.
Evaluate the given expression when the user changes the input. The expression is evaluated immediately, unlike the JavaScript onchange event which only triggers at the end of a change (usually, when the user leaves the form element or presses the return key).

+ ngClass	样式类
The ngClass directive allows you to dynamically set CSS classes on an HTML element by databinding an expression that represents all classes to be added.

+ ngClassOdd	样式类.
The ngClassOdd and ngClassEven directives work exactly as ngClass, except they work in conjunction with ngRepeat and take effect only on odd (even) rows.

+ ngClassEven	样式类
The ngClassOdd and ngClassEven directives work exactly as ngClass, except they work in conjunction with ngRepeat and take effect only on odd (even) rows.

+ ngCloak	样式类
The ngCloak directive is used to prevent the Angular html template from being briefly displayed by the browser in its raw (uncompiled) form while your application is loading. Use this directive to avoid the undesirable flicker effect caused by the html template display.

+ ngController	其他类
The ngController directive attaches a controller class to the view. This is a key aspect of how angular supports the principles behind the Model-View-Controller design pattern.

ngCsp	高级指令. 不考虑.
Angular has some features that can conflict with certain restrictions that are applied when using CSP (Content Security Policy) rules.

+ ngClick	    事件类.

Specify custom behavior on keypress event.

+ ngSubmit	    事件类.
Enables binding angular expressions to onsubmit events.

+ ngFocus	    事件类.
Specify custom behavior on focus event.

+ ngBlur	    事件类.

Specify custom behavior on copy event.

+ ngCut	        事件类.
Specify custom behavior on cut event.

+ ngPaste	    事件类.
Specify custom behavior on paste event.

+ ngIf	        其他类.
The ngIf directive removes or recreates a portion of the DOM tree based on an {expression}. If the expression assigned to ngIf evaluates to a false value then the element is removed from the DOM, otherwise a clone of the element is reinserted into the DOM.

+ ngInclude	    其他类.
Fetches, compiles and includes an external HTML fragment.

+ ngInit	    其他类.
The ngInit directive allows you to evaluate an expression in the current scope.

ngList	        不属于基础指令
Text input that converts between a delimited string and an array of strings. The default delimiter is a comma followed by a space - equivalent to ng-list=", ". You can specify a custom delimiter as the value of the ngList attribute - for example, ng-list=" | ".

+ ngModel	        其他类.
The ngModel directive binds an input,select, textarea (or custom form control) to a property on the scope using NgModelController, which is created and exposed by this directive.

ngModelOptions	   不属于基础指令
This directive allows you to modify the behaviour of ngModel directives within your application. You can specify an ngModelOptions directive on any element. All ngModel directives will use the options of their nearest ngModelOptions ancestor.

ngNonBindable	    不属于基础指令
The ngNonBindable directive tells AngularJS not to compile or bind the contents of the current DOM element, including directives on the element itself that have a lower priority than ngNonBindable. This is useful if the element contains what appears to be AngularJS directives and bindings but which should be ignored by AngularJS. This could be the case if you have a site that displays snippets of code, for instance.

ngOptions	    不属于基础指令
The ngOptions attribute can be used to dynamically generate a list of <option> elements for the <select> element using the array or object obtained by evaluating the ngOptions comprehension expression.

ngPluralize	        不是基础指令
ngPluralize is a directive that displays messages according to en-US localization rules. These rules are bundled with angular.js, but can be overridden (see Angular i18n dev guide). You configure ngPluralize directive by specifying the mappings between plural categories and the strings to be displayed.

+ ngRepeat	    其他类
The ngRepeat directive instantiates a template once per item from a collection. Each template instance gets its own scope, where the given loop variable is set to the current collection item, and $index is set to the item index or key.

+ ngShow	   样式类.
The ngShow directive shows or hides the given HTML element based on the expression provided to the ngShow attribute.

+ ngHide	样式类.
The ngHide directive shows or hides the given HTML element based on the expression provided to the ngHide attribute.

+ ngStyle	样式类.
The ngStyle directive allows you to set CSS style on an HTML element conditionally.

ngSwitch	 不属于基础指令
The ngSwitch directive is used to conditionally swap DOM structure on your template based on a scope expression. Elements within ngSwitch but without ngSwitchWhen or ngSwitchDefault directives will be preserved at the location as specified in the template.

ngTransclude	不属于基础指令
Directive that marks the insertion point for the transcluded DOM of the nearest parent directive that uses transclusion.

script	不属于基础指令
Load the content of a <script> element into $templateCache, so that the template can be used by ngInclude, ngView, or directives. The type of the <script> element must be specified as text/ng-template, and a cache name for the template must be assigned through the element's id, which can then be used as a directive's templateUrl.

select	不属于基础指令
HTML select element with angular data-binding.

+ ngRequired	表单类.
ngRequired adds the required validator to ngModel. It is most often used for input and select controls, but can also be applied to custom controls.

ngPattern	 不属于基础指令
ngPattern adds the pattern validator to ngModel. It is most often used for text-based input controls, but can also be applied to custom text-based controls.

+ ngMaxlength	 表单类.
ngMaxlength adds the maxlength validator to ngModel. It is most often used for text-based input controls, but can also be applied to custom text-based controls.

+ ngMinlength	表单类.
ngMinlength adds the minlength validator to ngModel. It is most often used for text-based input controls, but can also be applied to custom text-based controls.
